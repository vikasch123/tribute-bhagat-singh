    <h1>BHAGAT SINGH'S LEGACY</h1>
    <p class="para">Shaheed Bhagat Singh was an Indian revolutionary who played a crucial role in the struggle for India's independence from British rule. Born on September 28, 1907, in Banga, Punjab (now in Pakistan), he was deeply influenced by the nationalistic sentiments of his family and the atrocities committed by the British against Indians. Bhagat Singh is remembered for his bravery, intelligence, and dedication to the cause of Indian independence.

        He was a key member of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) and became famous for his involvement in revolutionary activities, including the bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in 1929. Along with Batukeshwar Dutt, he threw non-lethal bombs in the assembly to protest against repressive laws without intending to harm anyone. After the bombing, Bhagat Singh and Dutt were arrested. During his imprisonment, he became a symbol of the Indian freedom movement, inspiring many with his writings and speeches.</p>
